# MTPI/Santander Mobile Automation With Cucumber + Calabash  #

This is a small framework that uses Cucumber and Page Object to execute test on Selenium Webdriver for MTPI/Santander Solutions.

### Setting Up ###

Ruby 2.2-3 is recommended to run the tests. We're gonna use [RVM](https://rvm.io) to control the ruby version.

```
$ rvm install ruby-2.2.3
```

### Build and Run ###

To install all the required dependencies just run ```$ bundle install ``` in the project root folder.

To run the automation on your local you can follow the example below.
```
calabash-android run apps/TrianguloApp.apk
```

So... you might see something like this:
